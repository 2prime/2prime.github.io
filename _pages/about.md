The long term goal of my research is to develop a hybrid scientific research disipline which combines <mark color='orange'>domain knowledge</mark> (differential equation, stochastic process, control,...), <mark color='orange'>machine learning</mark> and <mark color='orange'>(randomized) experiments</mark>. To this end, I'm working on interdisciplinary research approach across probability and statistics, machine learning, numerical algorithms, control theory, signal processing/inverse problem and operations research. 

Here's my [<mark color='orange'>research statement</mark>](https://2prime.github.io/files/rs.pdf) and my latest [CV](https://www.overleaf.com/read/crybjbqmgxth).

> Although Ph.D. admissions to Northwestern IEMS are handled at a department-wide level, not by me individually, candidates with undergraduate backgrounds in applied mathematics/computational physics, computer science, or statistics are encouraged to contact me by email with the following documentation:
> - a current CV, which should include your previous research projects
> - A slide/review that provides a high-level overview of potential directions for our work together, with an emphasis on areas of overlap between our interests. (theoretical/computational are both welcome)


**Fine-grained research interest:** Scientific Machine Learning (AI4Science), Stochastic Simulation, Machine Learning Theory (RKHS, Empirical Process, Deep Learning), Inverse Problem, Robust Machine Learning
