Required undergraduate course on predictive modeling in data science. **Syllabus**:[[pdf]](https://2prime.github.io/files/IEMS304/SyllabusIEMS304.pdf)


### Objectives:

- Understand common data structures in modern predictive and explanatory modeling in business, engineering, and science and how to formulate the appropriate solutions.
- Learn R software basics and how to use it for various regression and classification problems.
- Develop ability to fit appropriate linear and logistic models, including model selection and model diagnostics.
- Develop ability to interpret fitted linear and logistic regression models for both explanatory and predictive purposes.
- Learn concept in regression and classification with nonlinearity, including maximum likelihood estimation, cross-validation, ridge and lasso.
- Learn how to fit and interpret popular supervised learning models including trees, smoothers, nearest neighbors, random forests, and boosted trees.
