Advanced graduate course on Uncertainty Quantification. 

## Syllabus

### Theortical Foundation
- Optimal Transport, Wasserstein Gradient Flow, Sampling [[textbook]](https://chewisinho.github.io/main.pdf)
- High Dimensional Probability [[textbook]](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~rvan/APC550.pdf)
- Functional Inequalities and Sampling, optimization in probability space
- Well-posed inverse problems; Bayesian posterior consistency; Bernstein Von Mises Theorem.

### Applications: Inverse Problems and Data Assimilation
