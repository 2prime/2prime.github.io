- Formulate, solve, apply, and interpret systems of linear equations in several variables;
- Compute with and classify matrices;
- Master the fundamental concepts of abstract vector spaces;
- Decompose linear transformations and analyze their spectra (eigenvectors and eigenvalues);

If you have a question, to get a response from the teaching staff quickly we strongly encourage you to post it to the class Piazza forum. For suggestions to improve Yiping's teaching, you can use the [(anonymous) form](https://forms.gle/Dtw6PRFdnbk8NQWRA). You can also leave a private matter here. If you wish to contact me via email, kindly include the tag "[linear algebra]" in the subject line. This will help ensure that I do not overlook your message.

For longer discussions with TAs and to get help in person, we strongly encourage you to come to office hours.

Syllabus
======
Linear algebra is an area of mathematics devoted to the study of structure-preserving operators on special sets (linear operators on vector spaces). Linear algebra is a cornerstone of any mathematics curriculum for two very important (and related) reasons:

- The theory of linear algebra is well understood and so a first step in many areas of applied mathematics is to reduce the problem into one in linear algebra.
- The spaces and operations studied in the subject are commonplace in many different areas of mathematics, science, and engineering.
