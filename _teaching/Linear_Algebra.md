- Formulate, solve, apply, and interpret systems of linear equations in several variables;
- Compute with and classify matrices;
- Master the fundamental concepts of abstract vector spaces;
- Decompose linear transformations and analyze their spectra (eigenvectors and eigenvalues);

- Apply orthogonal projection to optimization (least-squares) problems;
- Explore other topics (as time permits).

Syllabus
======
Linear algebra is an area of mathematics devoted to the study of structure-preserving operators on special sets (linear operators on vector spaces). Linear algebra is a cornerstone of any mathematics curriculum for two very important (and related) reasons:

- The theory of linear algebra is well understood and so a first step in many areas of applied mathematics is to reduce the problem into one in linear algebra.
- The spaces and operations studied in the subject are commonplace in many different areas of mathematics, science, and engineering.
